Classification models are used when we want to predict a categorical variable. Categorical variable can be of two kinds:
  Nominal: Categorical values without no intrinsic ordering. Example: Male/Female, True/False etc
  Ordinal: Categorical values with an order. Example: Small/Medium/Large, Elementary/Middle/High School etc
  
We will be looking at the following Classification models
1. K-Nearest Neighbour
2. Naive Bayes
3. Decison Tree
4. Logistic Regression
