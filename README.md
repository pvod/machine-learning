# Machine-Learning
This Repository includes my journey to Data Science learning. I have primarily used R and Python to model. 

To begin with, I will be looking at major machine learning algorithms that mainly fall under two categories:
1. Supervised Learning
    + [Regression] (https://github.com/pvod/machine-learning/blob/master/Regression)
    + Classification
2. Unsupervised Learning
    + Clustering
