# Machine-Learning
This Repository includes my journey to Data Science learning. I have primarily used R and Python to model. 

To Begin with, I will be looking at major machine learning algorithms that maily fall under two categories:
1. Supervised Learning
  + Regression
  + Classification
2. Unsupervised Learning
  + Clustering
